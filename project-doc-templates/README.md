# Project Doc Templates

The files here are intended to be copied to all new repositories created as SCITT Community projects.

When a [project](https://github.com/scitt-community/governance/blob/main/CHARTER.md#8-project-criteria) uses multiple repositories, one repo is designated as the root project, documented in the [PROJECTS.md](../PROJECTS.md) file.
The templated files here are copied to the root project, while the related repos for the project contain the links, pointing to the root project files.
